    <br>

    This will soon be our website, incorporating the google calendar API <br>
    The website will have a log in screen, then once logged in you'll be prompted to either create or search for a new planned event. <br>
    If you create a new one, you'll be promptes to name it, say available times, and be given a code to share to access the event. <br><br>

    We are currently still in the process of finalizing our plans for the website and soon will be working on more code.
